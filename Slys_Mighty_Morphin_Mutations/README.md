**The Sly Somnambulist's Mighty Morphin Mutations!**
 This mod rejiggers and strengthens some mutations and creates new ones to hopefully make the less flashy mutation lines more interesting to play and make mutations more fun overall.  It's a WIP of course, and I'd love any comments about balancing issues.  The overall intent is to try and help make each mutation line add a much more unique playstyle to the game. Requests, critiques, and suggestions are welcome!

**NOTE:**  *This mod rolls in a few of the changes/additional mutations first included by modders Peeved Penguin, Bl4nk, and Snowfielf.  If I didnt make a note of which ones those were in the code, lmk and I'll be sure to add it.*


**How It Works:**

This mod does not wholesale replace any mutation; when that tactic is used, it can cause issues with game updates and compatibility with other mods. Instead what it does is modify the original mutation inputs using deletes and extends, meaning nothing from the basegame will ever fully be overwritten, and there's a greater amount of compatibility with other mods that also need to touch the base mutations.

This mod also requires my [Mutation Mod Medley](https://github.com/captainsawbones/Sly_Mutation_Mod_Medley) as that is the rebalancing base I used to built this up from.


**How to Install:**

Download the zip and slap this baby contained within into your CDDA/Mods folder - NOT the CDDA/data/mods folder! The data/mods folder is intended for the mainlined mods, after all.


**Load Order:**

I'd suggest putting this near the top of your load order, or if you're particularly worried about compatibility, i'd load this after the last mod you have that alters mutations - since this would also add my own balance alterations on top of the other mods, without deleting them or modifying anything outside the bugfixes.


**Note to Modders:**

I tried to keep everything decently well-sorted and clearly delineated so that anyone who would like to contribute could do so a bit more easily, rather than dealing with a jumble of confusing looking spaghetti. That's the main/only reason you see the mutation files separated out as they are - for clarity's sake.
