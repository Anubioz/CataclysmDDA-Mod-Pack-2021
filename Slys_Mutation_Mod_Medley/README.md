**The Sly Somnambulist's Mutation Mod Medley!**

This CDDA modification is an attempt to gently rejigger the basegame mutations by fixing a few bugs that prevent some mutations from being properly reached, others from not being used in their intended threshold, things like that.  This does not add anything new or attempt to rebalance beyond what is absolutely required.


**How It Works:**

This mod does not wholesale replace any mutation; when that tactic is used, it can cause issues with game updates and compatibility with other mods.  Instead what it does is modify the original mutation inputs using deletes and extends, meaning nothing from the basegame will ever fully be overwritten, and there's a greater amount of compatibility with other mods that also need to touch the base mutations.

Want something to rebalance and hopefully make mutations more fun and interesting while also using this same 'keep it as compatible with other mods as possible' tactic?  Check out my [Mighty Morphin Mutations Mod](https://github.com/captainsawbones/Sly_Mighty_Morphin_Mutations).


**How to Install:**

Download the zip and slap this baby contained within into your CDDA/Mods folder - NOT the CDDA/data/mods folder!  The data/mods folder is intended for the mainlined mods after all.


**Load Order:**

I'd suggest putting this near the top of your load order, or if you're particularly worried about compatibility, i'd load this after the last mod you have that alters mutations - since this would also add my own balance alterations on top of the other mods, without deleting  them or modifying anything outside the bugfixes.
